# OMDB-FindMovies


## Introduction  
#### Small React Native Project with OMDB API for finding Movies with names to display posters, genre, plots, the released year.  
#### This app is optimized for iOS, but Android works perfectly the same.
#### This project took me 7 hours to meet the requirements & still in progress to optimize the code.
#### I will modify where I could have used call back for the most recent commit in the part where I was using async of fetchAPI to rerender the result.

## How to check the app out

### 1. Locally  
1. git clone this repository
2. Type "npm start" or "expo start" or "yarn start" [If expo or npm is already installed]
3. Enter "i" for iOS or "a" for Android or scan the QR code on the console to check it out on your own device.

### 2. Web app using the website.
1. https://omdb-findmovies.vercel.app/

This web app is only for showing how UI would work since API somehow not wokring using Expo web deployment and hosting it online.
However, you can check the web app version locally using **index.html** inside **web-build** folder
