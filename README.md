# OMDB-FindMovies


## Introduction  
#### Small React Native Project with OMDB API for finding Movies with names to display posters, genre, plots, the released year.  
#### This app is optimized for iOS, but Android works perfectly the same.
#### This project took me 7 hours to meet the requirements & still in progress to optimize the code.
